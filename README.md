# Redirect Connector Example

## Overview:
This redirect connector example illustrates a simplest connector which will redirect to an 3rd party URL.  A callback URL is displayed under the connection properties for the 3rd party service to return back to continue the Davinci Flow.

Only use this example if the connector you are building requires a full browser redirection to a 3rd party and returns to a Davinci URL to continue the execution of the flow. 

# Notes
Do not change the capabilities names as the current names indicate to Davinci that the connector is implementing a redirect flow
